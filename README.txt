The project goal is to create open source modern machinary to positron annhilation spectroscopy data analysis. This include

data exraction for experimental measurements,
data types for each type of measurement which supports all the relevant data analysis in the project
data analysis modules for each type of measurement In the long run, I hope to couple between positrons measurements to ab inito calculation. This might help research in the solid state branch to compare theortical calculation to measurements.
