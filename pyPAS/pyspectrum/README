This module suppose to be a tool for spectroscopy in general
yielding peaks_identifier in Spectrum and Peak for each peak, the module can be used to analyze general spectra.
However, for now, only gaussian shapes are analyzed in Peak. later that will bew extended.
Spectrum support pyshield for geometrical efficiency calculation and activity analysis.
later I hope to include alpha and beta mode.
