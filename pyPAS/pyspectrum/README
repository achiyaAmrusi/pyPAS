This module suppose to be a tool for spectroscopy in general
yielding peaks_identifier in Spectrum and Peak for each peak, the module can be used to analyze general spectra.
However, for now, only gaussian shapes are analyzed in Peak. later that will bew extended.
Spectrum support pyshield for geometrical efficiency calculation and activity analysis.
later I hope to include alpha and beta mode.

vision -
spectrum: fwhm and energy calibration, spectrum counts, (need calibration methods (channel in peaks)+energies - >new calibration
 or somthing like that )
peaks: peak spectrum(in a given domain), methods for counts, center, fwhm and so on
gamma_find_peaks: takes spectrum, find all/ specific peaks with their domain and return them as peak list
