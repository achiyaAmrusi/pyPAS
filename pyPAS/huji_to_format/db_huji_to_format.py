# functions to adjust input files into the relevant file
# each lab and equipment different and thus  will have their own format.
# Thus, a function to adjust the forma is very individualistic function.
# e.g. in our system, the data output comes with 5 lines before data and third column for pileup, and we clean it up
# the format to be use is the following:
# id file - data_base type
# basic_results
# advance_results
# the basic results file changes for each measurement DB\CDB\PALS
# the advanced results is dependent on the analysis function used.
# id file format :
# name sample_name
# data_base_type DB/CDB/PALS
# basic_results :
# dir_name DB/CDB
# for doppler broadening
# spectrum_files - positrons energy and pyspectrum
