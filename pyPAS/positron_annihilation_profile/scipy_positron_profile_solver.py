    """
    The solution for positron positron_implantation_profile boundary problem for given sample and positron energy.
    The solution method here uses scipy solve_bvp function in order to solve the self-consistent problem.
    because of its self-consisting nature this method is slow comparable with the matrix solution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    - positron_implementation_profile: xarray.DataArray
    A function of the thermal positrons per micron in the sample. see also ghosh_profile, makhov_profile
    - sample: Sample
    The sample for which the positron_implantation_profile is calculated,
      it is advised to define the last layer to be
        at least 3 mean free path from the end of the positron_implantation_profile (or where the implementation is negligible).
    - electric_field: xarray.DataArray
    The electric field value if it exists,
    If None, taken to be 0
    - num_of_mesh_cells: int
    The number of mesh cells for the system
    The function takes the total size of he sample, divide by num_of_mesh_cells,
     and this is the size of ever mesh cell
     default is 1000
    Returns
    -------
    The thermalized positron distribution in units of positrons per micron

        The ode for the positron diffusion-trapping-annihilation ode[]:

        The diffusion and and the annihilation rate depends on the material which depend on the location.
        density[0] is the positron density
        density[1] is the positron density derivative
